## :star: Introducing DrafterBench

The DrafterBench is designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) as an agent to automate monotonous, low-tech, and high-labor-intensity tasks in industry. Our initiative is drawing revision, which is a representation task in civil engineering that urgently needs to be automated. We took the following workflow to simulate the working scenario and evaluate the strengths and limitations of LLMs as automation agents.

![Automation Workflow](/figures/Workflow.png "Automation Workflow")

After the stage of preprocessing, the drawing revision tasks (summarized from the real world, totalling 1920 across 12 types) are converted into natural language processing (NLP) tasks to evaluate complex function calls instructed by intricate and lengthy content commands. We designed over 40 drawing revision tools and provided them to LLMs, which play different functions. Some of them aim to make visible changes to drawings, while the others serve necessary preparations for them (e.g., opening the file or transferring critical arguments). It's difficult to determine whether the tools called are effective and functioning properly from the revised drawings, especially when checking if there are redundant or duplicated invisible tools. Therefore, to accurately evaluate the models' performance, we score their responses based on the operation chains rather than the revised drawing results.

To record the operation chains, we prepared dual functions for the tools provided to the LLMs. Each dual function has the same name, input, and output type as the original tools, and its function is to capture the operation trajectories and valuable data in a well-structured JSON format (e.g., argument value, data type, etc.). During the working of the benchmark, the original tools called by the models will be replaced with dual functions to record both operation chains and final modification descriptions. The evaluator first checks whether the predicted final modification description matches the reference. If it matches, the implementation component receives full credit; otherwise, the evaluator falls back to trajectory-level comparison for detailed diagnosis.

There are four essential capabilities evaluated by DrafterBench:
- **Structured data understanding**
- **Function execution**
- **Instruction following**
- **Critical reasoning**

## :fire: <span id="quick-start">Quick Start</span>

### Preparation

First, configure an environment with Python 3.11 and download the repositories.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/anonymous733882/DrafterBench.git
cd DrafterBench
```

Then, install the dependencies.

```shell
pip install -e .
```

### Serve Model
- For API calling, set up your OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / Mistral / Deepinfra / AnyScale or other API keys as environment variables.

    ```shell
    OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
    MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
    DEEPINFRA_API_KEY=...
    HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=...
    ```
- For customized model, provide your vllm url when running evaluation.py

    ```shell
    --vllm_url http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8000/v1
    ```

### Run evaluation
Specify the --model and --model-provider flags to run DrafterBench. The supported models and providers are [available here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers). You can name your experiment with the --exp_name flag, or it will be set as "model+time+task_group" by default.
```shell
python evaluation.py --model gpt-4o-2024-08-06 --model-provider openai --temperature 0.0
```

- To run tasks of a specific set, use the --task_group flag. You can choose each set in ["Structured", "Unstructured", "Precise", "Vague", "Complete", "Error", "Single_Object", "Multiple_Objects", "Single_Operation", "Multiple_Operations"]. For example:

  ```shell
  python evaluation.py --model gpt-4o-2024-08-06 --model-provider openai --task_group Structured
  ```
  This command will run only the tasks in a structured language. The default task group is "All" tasks.

- To have a clear view of the result, you can set up your huggingface token, 
  ```shell
   HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=...
  ```
  then use the --huggingface_user_name flag to provide your Huggingface user name. Our benchmark will create a new dataset repository with the --exp_name and push the results to it. This repository is private by default, you can create a public repository by setting the --huggingface_private flag to False.
  ```shell
  python evaluation.py --model gpt-4o-2024-08-06 --model-provider openai --task_group Structured --huggingface_user_name XXXXX(Replace "XXXXX" with your Huggingface username)
  ```
- The default prompts for 12 tasks can be found in ./prompts. You are encouraged to develop your own prompts to achieve a higher score. To do so, simply replace the default prompts in .txt file with your new prompts.

- In case the evaluation is unexpectedly interrupted, DrafterBench supports resuming from existing results. You can specify the result file for resuming in the --resume_from flag. Alternatively, you can set the --auto_resume flag to True, and DrafterBench will automatically search the result directory for the latest file that matches the model name and task group, and resume the remaining evaluation process.
  ```shell
  python evaluation.py --model gpt-4o-2024-08-06 --model-provider openai --task_group Structured --resume_from *****.json
  ```
  ```shell
  python evaluation.py --model gpt-4o-2024-08-06 --model-provider openai --task_group Structured --auto_resume True
  ```

### Scalable Extension

The scalable task-extension code is included in `scal_extension/`. It contains task templates, controlled task scaling utilities, reference-generation utilities, and multi-turn expansion helpers.

To generate additional single-turn tasks, use `extension.py` with `--mode scale`. The `--num` flag controls how many tasks are sampled from each task family.

```shell
python extension.py --mode scale --num 5 --output scaled_tasks.json --model gpt-4o-mini --model-provider openai
```

To generate multi-turn expanded tasks, use `--mode expand`.

```shell
python extension.py --mode expand --num 2 --output expanded_tasks.json --model claude-3-5-sonnet-latest --model-provider anthropic
```

The supported model providers follow LiteLLM provider names. API keys should be configured as environment variables before running the extension command.
